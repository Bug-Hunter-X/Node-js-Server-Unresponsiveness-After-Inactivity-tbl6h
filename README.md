# Node.js Server Unresponsiveness After Inactivity

This repository demonstrates a scenario where a Node.js HTTP server becomes unresponsive after a period of inactivity.  This is an uncommon error, often stemming from subtle memory leaks or resource exhaustion issues not readily apparent during initial testing.

## Problem

A seemingly simple HTTP server may stop responding to requests after being idle for some time.  This isn't a typical error like a syntax error or a misconfiguration.  The server runs correctly initially, but after prolonged inactivity, it fails to process new requests.

## Solution

The solution might involve several steps, from optimizing code to adjust server configuration.  The provided `serverSolution.js` illustrates a possible approach using techniques to mitigate potential memory leaks or resource constraints.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node server.js`. 
3. Make a few requests to the server. 
4. Allow the server to remain idle for an extended period (e.g., several minutes).
5. Attempt to make additional requests.  Observe whether the server responds or not.
